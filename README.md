# Business-Simulation-Using-Excel

A radical insurance company that sits at the intersection of technology and human interaction. 
These machines study the consumers in these locations and suggest the best Insurance plans for these customers. 
I have created an industry-ready Excel simulation to forecast the business for the company and the different aspects required.

The simulation is able to forecast the business for the upcoming 2 years and also able to simulate it by chaning the current parameters.
